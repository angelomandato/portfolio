### Lunarmark

Lunarmark was the program to synchronize your bookmarks between multiple browsers any time you wanted. It made managing your bookmarks easy and efficient.

![Lunarmark Screenshot](images/lunarmark.png)

Lunarmark supported up to Internet Explorer 5, Netscape (all versions), and Firefox 2.x. Subsequent versions of browsers have made it difficult to maintain bookmark synchronization from outside of the applications, which made Lunarmark obsolete. Lunarmark would synchronize bookmarks found in the bookmarks.html of each Mozilla based browser and the bookmarks folders of Internet Explorer.

Developed in C++ with wxWidgets, featured SQLite database and web links within the application. Last release was in April 2005.
